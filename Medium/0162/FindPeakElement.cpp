/* A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
No adjacent two numbers are the same
Time complexity: O(log(n))
Additional memory complexity: O(1)
Idea: use binary search
